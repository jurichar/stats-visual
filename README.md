## Introduction

Welcome to the Age Calculator App project. This is a custom implementation, developed as part of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges, which allows users to calculate their age in years, months, and days based on their birth date. 

You can check out the live project [here](https://age-calculator-app-main-eight.vercel.app/).

## Project Features

The app allows users to:

- View their age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form.
- Get validation errors if any field is empty when the form is submitted, or if the day number is not between 1-31, the month number is not between 1-12, the year is in the future, or if the date is invalid.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.

## Development

The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is hosted on Vercel.
